This is my project for 4th semester of BCA course.
This project's title is Peer-To-Peer Household Tools and Electronics Rental Platform.
This platform will allow for users to list their items including but not limited to Drills, Speakers, Projectors, Hammers and other similar tools, similarly they can rent such items.
I have used Flutter (UI framework of Dart programming Language) for frontend and Supabase for backend.
